# MidPines Project

This project is intended to encompass a mock [GroupMe](http://groupme.com) server and client library. Named, respectively, UpperPines and LowerPines.
Currently only LowerPines is has any work done on it.

This is very much a work-in-progress and is **not** intended to be used in production environments.
